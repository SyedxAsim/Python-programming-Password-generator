Python project where I developed a password generator program. ✴ 
This application is designed to create strong, secure passwords for users by combining letters, numbers, and special characters. It features customizable options, allowing users to specify the length and complexity of the passwords according to their needs. The program ensures that generated passwords are both random and robust, enhancing security and reducing the risk of breaches. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in Python but also showcases my ability to implement effective security measures through practical programming solutions. I’m excited to share this project as it highlights my skills in creating useful tools for everyday security needs.
